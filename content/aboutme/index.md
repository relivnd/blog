Hej there! My name's Tobias and I live in Zürich, Switzerland.
I have a Computer Science (BSc Computer Science) degree from the University of Applied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland and work as a Software Engineer with a great passion for Cloud Technologies, an appreciation for DevOps culture and well-designed solutions.

# Education
After mandatory school, I did an apprenticeship from 2013 to 2017 as an Electronic Technician (Elektroniker EFZ) at Libs & National Instruments, focusing on measurement technologies and programming. Thanks to my experiences working in an international company, I returned to school and gained the vocational Baccalaureate from 2017 - 2018 to visit the University of Applied Sciences. After one year of military service as a strategic radio spotter, I started my studies in computer science in 2019.

# Work
## TomTom-Tools (2019 - 2023)
During my studies, I worked at a small company called TomTom-Tools (no, there are no ties with the navigation systems) which is leading in developing measurement and monitoring devices for the cement industry. Besides assembling devices - each device is hand-assembled in Switzerland - I've been responsible for testing their accompanying software measurement-studio as well as writing new test cases and maintaining the test catalogue.

## TEQLY (2022 - 2023)
TEQLY was the startup founded by my good friend Sandro together with my two fellow students and friends Jannik and Andreas, who asked me in the winter of 2021 if I would like to join the company to establish DevOps know-how within the organisation. During almost 2 years at TEQLY, we've come up with products like PROFLITE (a Drone Flying Service) or EASIT (a Hardware Rental Service), developed and integrated a tool-set for our own workflow like a ticketing solution, a security check for SMB's or multiple websites and last but not least we've consulted customers and executed small programming projects for them.
In the fall of 2023, we decided to close down TEQLY.

## tecRacer Consulting (2023 - 2025)
I worked as a Cloud Consultant at tecRacer GmbH in Zürich. Together with colleagues, we help SMBs in Switzerland with their challenges in the Cloud using mainly AWS services, Kubernetes, and Terraform.

## copebit AG (2025 - now)
Currently, I'm working as a Technical Sales Engineer & AWS Consultant @ copebit AG.

## Communities
As of 2025 I'm part of the AWS Community Builder program. I'm also helping to organize the [Containers on AWS Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/containers-on-aws-meetup-group/) in Zürich.

## Leisure time
In my leisure time, I like doing and watching sports. I run weekly with my running group through the streets of Zürich and on weekends I'm busy following the German Bundesliga or Formula 1. I love watching documentaries and reading the news. Since I spend a lot of time in front of computers, I compensate my screen time with a considerable houseplant collection and a lot of sport. On vacation, I prefer visiting museums to lying at the beach and the north over the south.
