Every once in a while I get a stage for the things I have to say... Here's a list of my appearances.

About the Talk:

My colleague Dario Duff and I gave a presentation on managing infrastructure resources using GitOps at the Containers on AWS Meetup, hosted by copebit AG. We began with an overview of Kubernetes and GitOps to establish a common understanding, then demonstrated how AWS infrastructure can be managed using Crossplane. In a brief demo, we showcased how to define AWS resources within Helm Charts using Crossplane, highlighting a practical GitOps approach to infrastructure as code.
