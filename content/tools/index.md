## Coding
Writing code is a big part of everyday life. Here are the tools I recommend.

### Zed
I'm a huge fan of Zed. At first it was just the speed that amazed me. Written in Rust, there's no comparison in speed to bulky editors like VSCode or heavy IDEs like IntelliJ. Although I've worked with both before and I think they're both great in their own way, my personal choice is Zed. But Zed isn't just blazingly fast. Zed offers features that make it stand out. The [remote development](/posts/develop-remotely-with-zed-aws) feature makes it easy to connect to development servers (e.g. a simple EC2 instance) and the AI capabilities are just on point. With their assistant features, LLMs facilitate your work exactly how and where you would expect it.
